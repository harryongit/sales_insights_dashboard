```

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harryongit/sales_insights_dashboard.git
   cd sales_insights_dashboard
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Input:** Place your sales data in the `data/raw/sales_data.csv` file. The CSV file must contain the following columns:
   - **order_date**: Date of sale (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)
   - **customer_id**: Unique identifier for the customer
   - **product_name**: Name of the product sold
   - **quantity**: Number of units sold
   - **unit_price**: Price per unit of the product sold

2. **Run the Analysis Pipeline:**
   After placing your sales data, run the following command to trigger the full analysis:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Reports:** Once the analysis is complete, the generated reports and visualizations will be available in the `reports/` directory. The reports include:
   - **Sales Trends Analysis** (Monthly, Quarterly, Year-over-Year growth)
   - **Customer Segmentation and Lifetime Value** breakdown
   - **Product Performance Report** with top and bottom-performing products
   
## Data Requirements
For the analysis to work seamlessly, the input CSV file must meet the following requirements:

| Column Name   | Description                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| order_date    | Date of the sale (Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| customer_id   | Unique identifier for the customer      |
| product_name  | Name of the product sold                |
| quantity      | Quantity of the product sold            |
| unit_price    | Price per unit of the product sold      |

## Key Insights Generated
The analysis generates several valuable insights to support business decisions:

1. **Sales Trends:**
   - **Monthly and Quarterly Analysis**: Visualize sales performance over different time periods.
   - **Year-Over-Year (YoY) Growth**: Identify seasonal trends and calculate growth rates across multiple years.

2. **Customer Analysis:**
   - **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers into segments based on their purchasing behaviors, such as high-value, frequent, or first-time buyers.
   - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Predict the total value a customer brings over the course of their relationship with the company.

3. **Product Performance:**
   - **Top and Bottom Performing Products**: Identify the best-selling products and the ones that may need attention.
   - **Product Category Analysis**: Understand which product categories contribute the most to overall sales and which need improvement.

## Future Improvements
The following improvements are planned for future releases:
- **Predictive Analytics:** Implement machine learning models to forecast sales and demand for specific products.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Develop a web-based dashboard for real-time data interaction and visualization.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Include additional visualization types like heatmaps, time-series forecasting charts, and advanced geographical analysis.
- **Seasonal Analysis:** Incorporate algorithms to detect seasonal sales patterns and adjust strategies accordingly.
